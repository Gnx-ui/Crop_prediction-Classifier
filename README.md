# Crop_prediction Classifier
The following repo contains a classifier that can predict type of crop based on biochemical and  biophysical component.


1.ideation: There are many  places where water is scarce, Somewhere there are not much nutrient value in the soil.I decided to help the Farmers using this model as they can grow crops based on the natural condition and can achieve high yield.

2.Scope: The Project can be used in agricultural field to increase type of crop growth and promote agriculture more.

3.Data Collection: For this  project I collected my data from Kaggle. The following data is uploaded by ATHARVA INGLE. The following dataset contains 7 features on which the classification is based.

4.Model overview and Performance:
The model is based on RandomForest
Classifier and able achieve 98% accuracy using the model. Upon Testing I've found that it classifies the out put correctly most of the times.
